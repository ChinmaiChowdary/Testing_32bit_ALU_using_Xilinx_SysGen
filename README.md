#Testing_32bit_ALU_using_Xilinx_SysGen

Xilinx System Generator for DSP (SysGen) is a MATLAB Simulink add-on that enables the development of architecture-level FPGA designs using graphical block programming. Simulink allows users to simulate their ideas, which may be packaged as a Vivado IP and quickly imported into a Vivado project.
